    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the churros, we begin by adding water, butter and sugar in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, then add the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and add flour and salt. Stir mixture until thickened (around 30 seconds). Let the mixture cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, using a hand mixer, beat the eggs in one at a time time everything is combined.  Then transfer the mixture to a piping page with a large star tip.</li>
        <li>In a large pot add in oil until halfway up the sides and heat to 375 degrees F over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Holding the piping bag a few inched above the oil, carefully pipe in 6" long ropes, using scissors to cut off each strand.</li>
        <li>Fry until golden, usually taking 4-5 minutes per churro. After each batch (3-4 churros per batch) let oil go back to 375 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Remove the churros with slotted spoon or tongs and immediately roll into cinnamon sugar. Then place the coated churros on a cooling rack.</li>
        <li>To make the chocolate sauce begin by placing the chcolate chips in a medium heatproof bowl. In another small saucepan bring heavy cream to a simmer over medium heat, then pour hot cream over chocolate chips and let sit for 2 minutes. Add the cinnamon and salt and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Serve churros and chocolate sauce and enjoy.</li>
