    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A rich and creamy custard dessert with a caramel taste. Typically made with a caramel top and a custard like bottom. Made using dairy and animal products. Will serve up to 6-8 dishes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 can of sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 can of evaporated milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Farenheit.</li>
        <li>Melt sugar in a medium sauce pan over a medium low heat until golden.</li>
        <li>Pour the liquid into a 9 inch wide round baking dish. Turn dish around to evenly coat the sides. This must be done with caution as the pan will be very hot. Once done, set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Then mix in the condensed milk, evaporated milk and vanilla until smooth. Once done, pour the mixture into the previously coated baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Place the dish into the oven and bake for approximately 60 minutes. <strong>Optional:</strong> Place the baking dish inside a waterbath (roasting pan with about 1 inch of water) before placing both in the oven.</li>
        <li>Once done, let the dish cool completly.  This can be done by placing the dish into the fridge and waiting an extra 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li>Once cooled take a large enough brimmed plate and flip the dish carefully onto it. The flan should fall onto the plate smoothly. If not give the dish a few taps or slowly shake the dish side to side to release the edges.</li>
        <Li>Slice and Serve.</Li>
